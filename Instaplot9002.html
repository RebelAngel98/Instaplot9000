My cousin pulled out a "+technology+" and recorded the whole thing. After watching the video on my cousin's "+technology+" my "+authorityTitle+" snapped at me for looking at the video. My "+career+" suggested I start to look for better things to do at work, however I disagreed. In the heat of my mid-life crisis at "+age+" I wanted to be a "+leastdangerousCareer+". Back when I had my apartment, I even had a total number of "+cats+" dogs! I need help, maybe even a total of "+videoGame+" hours per week of "+career+" to try and sort out these emotions."  ;

I should calculate it myself then. It shouldn't be too hard. However, you should do a few things for me. Do you see that start button in the corner? It should contain the power button, before clicking it, let me give you some instructions. Go to the welcome screen of the computer, and push the basic buttons of control, alt, and delete twice. Type Administrator in for the Username and leave the password blank, it'll have you type in a new password. After that is done, come back to me. You'll be able to fully see me.") ;
